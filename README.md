# Material_Invoice

Material Invoice is a Java application with a material based UI which allows an organisation to create a Invoice and shipping slip.
Material Invoice is not connected with any DB or File system but can be connected if need arises.

Later we will add .DOCX based document creation for Invoice and Shipping slip which we will do by using Aspose Plugin for .DOCX

#Material Design is based on the plugin for scene builder by JFoenix
